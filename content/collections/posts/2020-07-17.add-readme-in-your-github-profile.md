GitHub users can now add a readme file in their profile.
Here is how to do it:

- Log in to your GitHub account
- Go to [Create a new repository](https://github.com/new) page
- Write the **Repository name** exactly the same to your GitHub username. In my case my username devfaysal. So the repository was devfaysal/devfaysal. When you finish typing the repository name, it will appear a message like this-

- Keep the repository Public
- Check the Initialize this repository with a README 
- You are done. Now write whatever you like in that readme file
- Then go to your profile to see how it looks like.
- Do not forget to share it with your friends.
